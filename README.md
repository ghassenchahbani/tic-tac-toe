The Interactive Tic Tac Toe Game is a web-based implementation of the classic two-player game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid fills up before either player achieves this, the game ends in a draw.

Features:

User Interface: A visually appealing interface created using HTML and CSS displays the Tic Tac Toe grid and provides a clear indication of whose turn it is and the game's outcome.
Interactive Gameplay: Players can interact with the grid by clicking on the cells to place their symbols. JavaScript handles the logic behind updating the grid and determining the winner.
Player vs Player Mode: Players can compete against each other on the same device, taking turns to make their moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
Win Detection: JavaScript checks after each move if either player has won the game by achieving a winning alignment of their symbols.
Draw Detection: If the grid fills up without a winner being determined, the game declares a draw.
Responsive Design: The game interface adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
